# Game_Dont-Stop-Yell
This repository will show you the basal scripts of a very interesting game, which is very hot several years ago.  
The game is a creative game,you must push your player to move by your voice.It is made by Unity,and my script is for Unity too.  
the script can detect your voice volumn,and control your player to move when your voice is big enough.
